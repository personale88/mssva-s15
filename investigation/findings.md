**Title:** Authentication logic allows access without password  
**Flag:** Design Assumption Broken  
**Location:** nuclei-bootcamp/apps/ch1-auth/app.py  
**Trigger Condition:** POST request to /login with username but without password  
**Root Cause:** The authentication flow assumes that the presence of a username is sufficient for partial authentication and issues an access token without validating credentials.  
**Impact:** Unauthorized users can obtain an access token without providing valid authentication credentials, breaking the intended security model.  
**Evidence:** A POST request containing only a username returns a 200 OK response with a token (`internal-access`), demonstrating authentication bypass.
